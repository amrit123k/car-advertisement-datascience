# car-advertisement-datascience


This project explores a dataset of vehicles listed for sale in the United States. It includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of vehicle features such as price, model year, mileage, condition, and more. A Streamlit web app (`app.py`) is included to provide an interactive dashboard for visualizing key trends and insights.
